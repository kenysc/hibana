“If our voice is loud enough to threaten the fireworks, there may still be a chance to make a difference, but in fact, our voice is so faint that only those who curious can hear it.”

“如果我们的声音大得足以威胁到烟火，或许还有可能改变什么结果，但实际上我们的声音小得可怜，只有认真想听的人才听得见。”

hibana (火花), literally “spark”, is abrupt and grandiose premeditation.  At the end of January 2012, I was staring over Victoria Harbour by the window beside Nathan Road. The crowd on the street was surging forward, evaporating the damp temperature in the drizzle. Fireworks continue to bloom, and people seem to be caught in an infectious ecstasy. I have the ability to move myself. I like the vintage things in the dim light, the change of the sky from purple to indigo at dusk, the rust color under the drainpipe of the old house, and the prepared unpredictable, wet and cool weather, and the unintentional electricity through my body. When the last firework rose, the crowd hold their breath to the rising star. I’m obsessed with the silence, which satisfies the eagerness of almost certain and unrealistic illusions. When it exploded, everyone was illuminated in a brilliant desire, and found their reflection in the spark.

hibana（火花），是突然而宏大的预谋。二〇一二年一月末，我在弥敦道旁的窗边，盯着维港出神。街上的人潮向前涌动，不断蒸发着细雨里的阴冷温度。烟花轮番上演，人群仿佛陷入易感的狂喜。我有一种自我感动的能力。我喜欢昏暗光线中的古旧事物，喜欢黄昏时天空逐渐变黑，喜欢老房子排水管底下的锈迹，也喜欢铺垫好的不出意外，潮湿阴冷的空气，和不经意间的毛骨悚然。当最后一发烟花升起时，人群将呼吸留给了那截上升中的火球。我沉迷于这种沉默，它满足了呼之欲出的热切和不切实际的期待。爆炸时，每个人都在灿烂的一瞬间被点亮，又在那片火花中找到自己的倒影。

hibana is a proof of presence. The design is based on my selfish motives, it is my externalization and my reflection. It’s an open source sans-serif typeface and is committed to supporting all languages in the world. It has only one weight (450) between regular and medium bold in the spring of 2020, and presented as a relatively high character width. Hibana is Naoki Matayoshi's novel, which won the 153rd Akutagawa Award.

hibana 是一份在场证明。它即出于这种私心设计，是我的外化，也是我的倒影。它是开源的无衬线体并致力于支持世界上的所有语言。它在二〇二〇年春只有一种介于常规体和中粗体间的字重（450），并属于一种相对偏高的字宽。火花源于又吉直树（Naoki Matayoshi）的同名中篇小说，它获得了第153回芥川龙之介赏。
